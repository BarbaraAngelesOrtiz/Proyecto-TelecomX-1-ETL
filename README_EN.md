## 📊 Customer Churn Study

Project carried out within the framework of the Oracle-Alura Latam Data Science Challenge. This project seeks to identify the factors that influence customer churn within a service company. To achieve this, a comprehensive process was carried out, including data collection from an API, its cleansing, analysis, and visualization.

Exploratory analysis tools and interactive visualizations were used to discover key patterns and generate reports that help make decisions focused on improving user retention.

Exploratory analysis tools and interactive visualizations were used to discover key patterns and generate reports that help make decisions focused on improving user retention.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

* Obtain and process data from an external API.
* Implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process.
* Clean and organize data for analysis.
* Develop key visualizations to identify behavioral patterns.
* Explore the data and generate a report with significant findings.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Google Collaboration
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* SeaBorn
* Plot
* Requests (for API connection)

## 🧠 Key Insights
* Certain customer profiles are more likely to churn, such as those with higher monthly charges or shorter tenure.
* Usage and billing patterns associated with churn are detected.
* Visualizations allowed customers to be segmented into risk groups and relationships between key variables to be established.
* The analysis suggests retention actions based on the customer profile.
